described in JSON format.So, basically, It imports the searched results(as per the input by the user) from 
JSON file without loading the complete page by using AJAX(Asynchrnous javascript and XML) concepts.It uses 
jQuery for POST/GET requests and for other miscellaneous functions such as fade in and fade out etc.
